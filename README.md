- **Electronic Health Records Access**: Enables easy access and management of health records.

## System Architecture
The CareCompanion app employs a robust system architecture combining frontend and backend technologies such as React for dynamic UIs, Node.js with Express for the server environment, and MongoDB for data storage. This setup ensures scalability, security, and an efficient data flow.

## App Design
Designed with input from healthcare professionals and patients, the app focuses on clarity, simplicity, and accessibility. Features include simplified login/signup screens, a doctor dashboard for managing patient information, and a patient overview for tracking medical history and appointments.
